# 🚀 CrewAI: Orchestrating Autonomous AI Agents

**CrewAI** is a cutting-edge framework for orchestrating **autonomous AI agents**.

## 🎯 What is CrewAI?
CrewAI enables you to create AI teams where **each agent** has:
- **Specific roles**
- **Assigned tools**
- **Defined goals**

These agents work **together** to accomplish complex tasks efficiently.

## 🏆 Why CrewAI?
Think of it as **assembling your dream team** – each agent brings **unique skills** and expertise, collaborating seamlessly to achieve your objectives.

With CrewAI, AI agents don’t just work – they **work together**. 🤖🤝🚀



### **✨ Key Features of CrewAI**

✔ **Modular Agent Design** – Each agent is built with a unique role and capabilities.

✔ **Task Delegation** – Agents can perform individual tasks or delegate work to others.

✔ **LLM Integration** – Agents can leverage different **Language Models (LLMs)** for reasoning.

✔ **Multi-Agent Collaboration** – Agents work together in a structured workflow.
