  description: |
    Research and find the following factual information:
    
    1. What is the maximum running speed of a leopard in km/h?
       - Look for scientifically documented top speeds
       - Note: Leopards are one of the faster big cats
    
    2. What is the length of the Pont des Arts bridge in Paris in meters?
       - This is a pedestrian bridge over the Seine River
       - Look for official measurements
    
    Use the web search tool to find accurate, current information.
    Report your findings clearly with the specific numbers.
  
  expected_output: |
    A clear report containing:
    - Leopard's maximum speed in km/h (with source if available)
    - Pont des Arts bridge length in meters (with source if available)
    - Any relevant notes about the data

calculation_task:
  description: |
    Using the research data provided, calculate how many seconds
    it would take for a leopard running at maximum speed to cross
    the Pont des Arts bridge.
    
    Steps:
    1. Take the leopard's speed in km/h from the research
    2. Convert to m/s by dividing by 3.6
    3. Take the bridge length in meters from the research
    4. Apply the formula: Time (seconds) = Distance (meters) / Speed (m/s)
    5. Round to 2 decimal places
    
    Show your calculations step by step.
